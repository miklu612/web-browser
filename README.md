# Unnamed Browser Project

This is a ambitious project that probably won't be finished, but I wanna see
how far I can get with it. The primary motivation for creating this project was
the constant worsening of the web as a whole. Everyone, including the browsers,
feels as if they are only in it for the money, hold for a couple of exceptions.

The main goal for now is to have a web browser that """"""""works"""""""" if
you really try to use it and there is no other choice.
